I am a data engineer at [NCX](https://ncx.com) where I write code to run our
natural capital marketplace.
My educational background is in forestry and statistics, but I have spent most
of the last decade honing my programming skills on the job at NCX (formerly
SilviaTerra).
My programming specialty is building clean and elegant systems for processing
geospatial data.

## Experience

**Data Engineer** NCX, Remote | January 2021 - present

* Built and maintained multiple pipelines for processing and organizing
  geospatial data:
  * model training- and prediction pipeline for combining public satellite  
    imagery datasets and ground measurements to predict forest vegetation
    structure for the contiguous US
  * forest carbon assessment pipeline capable of concurrently processing
    thousands of user-submitted property boundaries
  * NCX's SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)
* Deployed machine learning and Bayesian statistical models in production
  * Python: pytorch, fastai, tsai
  * R: brms
* Distributed data products to the NCX Platform Team for consumption on NCX's 
  Landowner Platform
* Maintained unit testing and CI/CD for multiple Python + R packages and 
  associated processing workflows in GitHub actions
* Managed and deployed the docker images used for development within the NCX
  data team
* Deployed serverless infrastructure for the STAC API and tiling services in
  AWS using CloudFormation, RDS, and Lambda
* Explored emerging technologies for analyzing and processing geospatial data
  and deployed them into production pipelines and platforms
  * e.g. eoAPI, titiler-pgstac, stac-fastapi, stackstac, xarray

**Forest Biometrician** SilviaTerra, Remote | June 2016 - December 2020

* Developed processes for generating forest inventory data using ground
  measurements paired with remote sensing data
  * built and maintained a suite of Python and R packages for processing remote
    sensing data and rendering model predictions.
  * implemented rigorous statistical methods for generating model-assisted
    estimates of forest structure
* Operated and configured the cloud computing infrastucture to generate forest
  inventory estimates for millions of acres
* Communicated with industrial forest management companies to understand their 
  forest inventory data needs
