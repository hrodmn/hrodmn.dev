I am a data engineer at [NCX](https://ncx.com) where I write code to run our
natural capital marketplace.
My educational background is in forestry and statistics, but I have spent most
of the last decade honing my programming skills on the job at NCX (n√©e
SilviaTerra).
My programming specialty is building clean and elegant systems for processing
geospatial data.
