I am a data engineer at [NCX](https://ncx.com) where I spend my days writing the
code that runs our natural capital marketplace.
My educational background is in forestry and statistics, but I have spent most
of the last decade honing my programming skills on the job at NCX (n√©e
SilviaTerra).
My favorite thing to do at work is to build clean and elegant systems for
processing geospatial data.

I have learned everything I know about programming from open-source developers,
my coworkers at NCX, my classmates at OSU, and the many helpful and kind
strangers that post questions/answers/ideas on the internet!

## Experience

NCX | Data Engineer | Jan 2021 - present

- Responsibilities
  - Build and maintain data pipelines for processing geospatial data
    - languages: Python, R
    - operating systems: Ubuntu
    - tools: GDAL, STAC (`stac-fastapi`, `pgstac`), PostgreSQL, `xarray`, `Dask`,
  `rasterio`, `shapely`, MapReduce, Docker
    - clouds: AWS and Azure
    - CI/CD: GitHub Actions
    - code review: GitHub pull requests
  - Design pipelines for processing, storing, and organizing raster and vector
    data
    - reprojection
    - geometry operations
    - cloud-optimized formats
    - visualization
  - Work with data scientists to deploy machine learning and Bayesian statistical
    models
    - R packages: `brms`, `tidyverse`, `furrr`, `future`
    - Python packages: `fastai`, `tsai`, `xgboost`, `cmdstanpy`
  - Work with platform team to distribute data products to NCX's Landowner
    Platform
    - collaborate with platform engineers to define and maintain API endpoints for
      the data processing pipeline
  - Build systems up from POC to production
    - discover existing data that can help solve a business problem 
    - develop minimal methods for distilling raw data into useful information
    - rapidly iterate until reaching a workable solution for the problem at hand
- Project highlights:
  - NCX internal STAC
    - designed a python API that uses `pypgstac` and `rio_stac` to generate STAC
    metadata for raster data products that we created in-house, 
    - implemented unit testing framework using `pytest-postgresql`
    - this work enabled rapid iteration on modeling efforts by data scientists 
  - MapReduce + Python + R pipeline for generating forest carbon assessments for
  landowner property boundaries
    - built process to handle messy user-submitted property boundary geometries
    with minimal data loss
    - built a system capable of making pixel-wise computations for thousands of
    properties concurrently
    - reduced predictions down a one-line data summary to populate the
    landowner-facing report
  - Forest vegetation modeling imagery processing pipeline
    - Assembled cloud-free imagery for the continental US
      - Landsat 8, Sentinel 2
      - apply BRDF correction
      - create mosaics for modeling at the ecoregion scale
    - Built prediction API for generating estimates of forest vegetation
    structure for any AOI

SilviaTerra | Forest Biometrician | June 2016 - Dec 2020

- Responsibilities
  - Design processes for generating forest inventory using remote sensing data
  paired with on-the-ground measurements
    - train statistical models to predict forest structure as a function of
      remotely-sensed information and demographic information about the forest
    - build and maintain the infrastructure for summarizing the model
      predictions into a deliverable format
  - Work with clients (industrial forest management companies) to understand
  their needs for forest inventory and how to provide the most useful data
  product for their operations

- Project highlights
  - Designed a parameterized system for computing sample statistics for forest
  inventory data
    - flexible estimation of many forest vegetation structure parameters at
    various scales (e.g. stratum-level density of oak basal area, stand-level
    density of all tree species)
  - Maintained and improved a pipeline for pairing field measurement plots with
  remote sensing data for local models of forest vegetation structure
  - Learned cloud compute infrastructure by close collaboration with more
  experienced software engineers
