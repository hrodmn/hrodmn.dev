I am a data engineer at [NCX](https://ncx.com) where I write code to run our
natural capital marketplace.
My educational background is in forestry and statistics, but I have spent most
of the last decade honing my programming skills on the job at NCX (formerly
SilviaTerra).
My programming specialty is building clean and elegant systems for processing
geospatial data.
