I am a data engineer at [NCX](https://ncx.com) where I spend my days writing the
code that runs our natural capital marketplace.
I have learned everything I know about programming from open-source developers,
my coworkers at NCX, my classmates at OSU, and the many helpful and kind
strangers that post questions/answers/ideas on the internet!

SilviaTerra | Forest Biometrician | June 2016 - Dec 2020

- Design processes for generating forest inventory using remote sensing data
paired with on-the-ground measurements
  - train statistical models to predict forest structure as a function of
    remotely-sensed information and demographic information about the forest
  - build and maintain the infrastructure for summarizing the model predictions
    into a deliverable format
- Work with clients (industrial forest management companies) to understand their
needs for forest inventory and how to provide the most useful data product for
their operational needs
